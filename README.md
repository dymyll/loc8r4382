MY READ ME


This is for Assignment 1

I will be creating a application, compliments of Simon Holmes, that displays a few pizza places. 
It will have a locations page, about page, and a review page. 




- Obtain Simon's chapter 4 code and git pull or download it.
- Modify the code to include an additional list page of three (3) select pizza restaurants in Amarillo and/or Canyon (this means another tab in the navigation for the pizza places)
- Modify the code to develop attributes for each restaurant (they will be different than what Simon uses for locations.
- Modify and/or Copy and Moidy the layout.jade, location-info.jade, and locations-list.jade files to accomplish these tasks.
- Since Simon is using a 3rd party Bootstrap theme, you should do so as well.  The results may not be what you expect, but I want you to experiment
- Create an additional mixin that will also shade the background of each item in the locations-list for your pizza restaurants different colors depending on their rating.
